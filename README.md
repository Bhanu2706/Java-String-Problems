# Java-String-Problems
This repository contains solutions to various string manipulation problems in Java. The problems are based on common string operations and algorithms, such as reversing a string, finding palindromes, checking anagrams, merging strings, and more.

Problems Covered:
Add Characters to a String: Adds additional characters to an existing string.
Anagram Check: Determines if two strings are anagrams of each other.
Even Length Words: Finds words in a string that have even lengths.
Get Character from String: Retrieves a character at a specified position in a string.
Insert String: Inserts one string into another string at a specified position.
Iterate Over String with Space: Iterates over each character in a string and prints them with a space between each.
Length of Last Word: Returns the length of the last word in a string.
Merge Strings: Merges two strings by alternating their characters.
Palindrome: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
Palindrome Check: A more comprehensive solution to check if a string is a palindrome.
Repeated DNA Sequences: Finds all 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a given DNA string.
Reverse String: Reverses a string.
Reverse Words: Reverses the order of words in a sentence.
Roman to Integer: Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.
String Contains: Checks if one string contains another string.
String Insertion: Inserts a substring into a string at a specific position.
String to Array: Converts a string into an array of words.
Swap Numbers: Swaps two numbers in a string.
Swap Strings: Swaps two strings in a string array.
Swap Without Third Variable: Swaps two numbers or strings without using a third variable.
Word Count: Counts the number of words in a given string.
